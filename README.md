# Climate Policy Radar's Technical Test
This repo contains my answers to Climate Policy Radar's technical test. I chose to answer Question 1, analysing the national climate targets dataset, generating insights to inform product development. I spent about 30 mins formualting my approach to the question and setting up my environment, 2 hours working on the technical solution, and another 30 mins finalising the write-up. Overall, this was a very fun problem to approach and I hope I managed to demonstrate my problem solving capabilities! :) 

### Write-up
I decided to use **Jupyter Notebooks** to structure my write-up. While Microsoft Word or PowerPoint may have been more professional choices for distributing technical reports, I realised that integrating my explanations within my code should make the write-up a bit quicker, as all of my plots, ways-of-thinking, results are already on the page. Therefore, in this repo, my write-up is in the file **Beth S CPR Technical Test.ipynb** (there is also as an html export in case the notebook fails to load visuals). 

### Code
To reduce the complexity of my notebook, I moved all functional code to a separate python file. This meant performing each task in the write-up only required a few lines, and the focus in the write-up can be on the results instead of the technical nitty gritty. To view my code, please refer to the **data_utilities.py** file. 

### Reproducibility
I created a virtual environment with anaconda to complete this task. The requirements.txt file lists all the packages I imported.
